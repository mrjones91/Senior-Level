# It Is What It Is

### What this book is

A collection of knowledge and wisdom for those transitioning into or already climbing the ladder of a programming centric career, namely a Web Developer.

### What it isn't

A tutorial book. Resources for finding tutorials to master your respective language and stack will be provided, but this is in no way meant to teach you HOW to build the cool things you need and want; merely what to do and how to steer your career while you're building cool things.
