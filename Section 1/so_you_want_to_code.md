# So You Want To Code (For a Living)

### Expectations
The world at large still has a myriad of expectations and misconceptions of what is is be like to be a programmer. Even (aspiring) developers, whether you're enamored with the hot buzz words, high salaries, mind breakingly awesome future in front of your face, or just want to make a robot to clean your house and rub your feet don't know for sure what it is like working as a programmer until they get a job in it. Specifics will differ from industry to industry and business to business, but expectations like reaching a stage where you will feel like you know and can handle it all; being able to write error free code the first time; working with teams where EVERYONE knows EVERYTHING that you know; and any other assumption you may have about your workplaces, coworkers, and even your own code are generally going to be wrong!

### Reality
Now that you understand that you are a mere mortal and fallible being, {nothing wrong with that, all of the greatest people to ever walk the Earth have been the same way} I can you to understand a more grounded and realistic approach to the worlds of code around us.

#### "Expert"
Becoming an expert, knowing everything about everything, is impossible. Again, not to unmotivate you, but to reframe your mind. In due time, with enough work and hours put in to this craft, you will learn 

#### Debugging
Code never works as expected. Things will break along the way, whether you're an expert or novice. That's life, that's computer science. Thus code is life [T-Shirt Link Here]
#### Team Dynamics
Teams often have their OWN way of doing things. Sometimes even in spite of company policies to do otherwise. Things like Unit Testing, Code Reviews, and Project Documentation are all great concepts and important for Accountability and cohesiveness as a project or business gets larger than 1-3 person dev teams. However, the majority of businesses and the software that they need to function daily will not NEED these things in the formal way that you may have learned in college.

Unit Tests: Code that is written to automate the process of testing the code
Code Review: Periodical checking of the writing of code to adhere to coding standards
Project Documentation: Documentation used by a development team to chart out the idea for what is being created into plan
